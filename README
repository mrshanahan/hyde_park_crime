Hyde Park Crime Data

This program will compare the crime rates on four campuses - UChicago, IIT,
UIC East, and DePaul (Loop) - based on Chicago crime data from
data.cityofchicago.org.

To use, just run ./hpc.py with the data files as arguments.  Best results are
achieved by labeling files as data_([a-zA-Z0-9\-]+)(_.*)?.csv, where group 1
is the year that the file represents. Downloading pylab is highly recommended,
as this will allow a graphical representation, as opposed to a ASCII-text table.

Year data is really only useful with the graph, so files can be named whatever
without pylab (though preferably named uniquely within the year, if they do
follow the format).

Results of running without pylab:
